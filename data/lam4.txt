-*-mcnpgen-*- Example 6.6 Lamarsh-homog u235/water cyl,s(a,b),n+p,temperature
c 
c this example shows how to instruct MCNP to transport at a material temperature
c      of 600 K (note that the density of the water in this example is not actually 
c      changed to that of water at 600K but should be for real analysis calculations)

c tallies
c 
c MCNP doesn't know the source strength or normalization, it provides tally results
c in terms of per source particle, we must supply the source strength 
c (e.g. neutrons/sec)
c      We know this approximately from the power level and basic fission physics:
c For a power level of 5 watts:
c source strength=
c 5watt*2.4neut/fiss*1fiss/180.88MeV*1MeV/1.602e-13 wattsec=4.141e11 neut/sec
c 
c   We may need to iterate on some of these numbers using MCNP for consistency
c 
c       from keff box e.g. final estimated combined...keff
c            average number of neutrons produced per fission = 2.436
